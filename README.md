# dig-conversion
As part of my digital circuits course, we utilized many conversions (from number conversions to format conversions). I created this project to quickly convert through sometimes intensive conversions (if otherwise done by hand, such as custom IEEE conversions that involve non-conventional mantissa and exponent formats).

In short, this is a repository with programs that will compute conversions commonly used when dealing with digital circuits (ex: IEEE conversion).

# Currently includes:
-custom IEEE to BINARY format

-BINARY to custom IEEE format
